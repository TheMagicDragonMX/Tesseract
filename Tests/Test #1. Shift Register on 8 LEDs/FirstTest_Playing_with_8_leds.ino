Notes
1째 -> Byte Manipulation
Tried to manupulate the output by using "byte" type and shift operator, I discarted the idea 
becaouse it was going to be difficult to select which leds would turn on

2째 -> Int aray with numbers
I used an int array that keeped the number that represents each led on the shift register, it worked well
so I think I will improve it by using enums to refer those numbers
 
3째 -> Adding an enum
Adding an enum that works as interpreter of the int array indexes works fine, now it easy to send a number
to the shift register, next step is evaluate how it could work with PWM

UPDATE: LED's only use a max value of 6 mA, giving a max of 384 mA for an entire floor of 64 LED's, Arduino
suports a current supply of 400 mA, so it is perfectly fine for an entire floor :,D
With that said, lets see how we can implement PWM

4째 -> First PWM interaction
Now I can set an special voltage value to every led in the register, with everyone having the same voltage, 
now I'll try to make every LED individual.

UPDATE: Giving each LED a PWM value in particular seems very difficult, so I'm going to use the already existent
PWM Shift Register library, which I'll test in another .ino file
