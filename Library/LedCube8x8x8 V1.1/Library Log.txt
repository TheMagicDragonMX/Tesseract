Problem: Not getting anything from the Cube Array
#1. I was using digitalWrite() before using pinMode(), I moved that to setCubePins()

#2. Ok, for each works just if the array actually contains something

#3. Arrays must me initialized

#4. Yay! Now the Cube Array shows values

Problem: Setter functions are not working
#5. Using for works, but range based for doesn't

#6. Yay! Iterator item must be a reference if we want to change its content

Problem: The cube is not lighting up
#7. Ok I'll be atempting to work with the top floor so I can see if the registers are getting data

#8. Check if floorID array is working

#9. Bruh I initialized wrong the array

#10. Nope, it wasn't the array... Which makes sense, going back to entry #8

#11. Yup, it's working, going back to entry #7

#12. Well, the turnOnFloor() function is doing well

#13.
