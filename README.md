# Tesseract LED Cube
An 8x8x8 LED Cube that I built using Arduino

## Motivation
At some point in my career, our group took a course of electronics and I fell in love with them. Eventually they taught us about Arduino, which after all we went before resulted as the greatest and powerful tool for me. **I was so amazed by it!**

One day I found a video about cool electronic projects that could be done with Arduino, and a LED Cube was one of them. So I said to myself... **Why not?**

`This is my first electronic project, and I'm so proud of it ^w^`

## The arrangement building
### The idea
I started to think on how I could build the cube. At first I thought about building a `3x3x3`

The first problem I encountered was the building of the cube itself, **how could I put LEDs one next to other?** 

First I tried to directly weld them one next to other, and after some time and practice I managed to create a base of almost like 30 LEDs (yup, eventually I decided to go for the `8x8x8` size, the more the better right?)

### Change of plans
After that arrangement was getting bigger more problemas appeard, yes, the leds were welded but they weren't strong enough, **and they were only 30 of them!**
